# Tetra_Simulink

This simulates the motion of modular tetrahedral-shaped aerial robots.

Run on MATLAB 2022a:

```
rotors_prg.m
```

This simulation model is used in the paper titled “A Non-planar Assembly of Modular Tetrahedral-shaped Aerial Robots” by Obadah Wali, Mohamad T. Shahab, Eric Feron, appearing in the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), London, United Kingdom, held on 29 May – 02 June 2023. 

[The Simulink models are based, in part, on examples from UAV Toolbox Support Package for PX4 Autopilots]
